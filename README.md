Project Explanation: Custom printf Implementation

The project aims to create a custom implementation of the printf function in the C programming language. The standard printf function is a powerful and widely used function for formatted output. It takes a format string as input, which contains placeholders for various data types, and produces formatted output according to the provided format.

The custom _printf function will mimic the behavior of the standard printf function by handling various conversion specifiers and producing formatted output. However, the custom implementation will have certain limitations to simplify the development process.

Key Features of the Custom _printf Function:

    Handling Conversion Specifiers: The _printf function will be able to handle the following conversion specifiers:
        %c: Character
        %s: String
        %%: Percentage sign
        %d and %i: Signed integers
        %u: Unsigned integer
        %o: Octal number
        %x and %X: Unsigned hexadecimal (lowercase and uppercase)

    Custom Conversion Specifiers: The custom _printf function will also handle some custom conversion specifiers:
        %b: The unsigned int argument will be converted to binary representation.
        %S: Strings with non-printable characters (ASCII value < 32 or >= 127) will be printed as "\x" followed by the ASCII code value in hexadecimal (uppercase - always 2 characters).
        %r: Reverses the string and prints it.
        %R: Applies the ROT13 substitution cipher to the string and prints it.

    Handling Flags and Modifiers: The custom _printf function will not handle flag characters, field width, precision, or length modifiers to simplify the implementation.

    Performance Optimization: The _printf function will use a local buffer of 1024 characters to minimize the number of calls to the write function, improving performance.

The project will be hosted on a GitHub repository to allow collaboration and version control. Each task will be implemented incrementally, starting from basic functionalities and gradually adding more advanced features.

Developers will contribute to the project by working on different tasks and sub-tasks to complete the implementation. Proper documentation and comments will be added to ensure code readability and maintainability.

By the end of the project, the custom _printf function should be a functional and efficient alternative to the standard printf function, meeting the specified requirements for various conversion specifiers and custom functionalities.
